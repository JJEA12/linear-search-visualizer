# Algorithm Name 
Linear Search
Why I chose it: I chose this algorithm for the level of simplicity and understanding it takes to code and inturn customize.

## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the  four pillars of computational thinking  briefly in bullets)

# Decomposition:
- Generate random list of numbers
- Chose a random target
- show what pivot youre on in array
- uses colours and bars to represent
# Pattern Recognition
- check index 1
- check index 2
- check index 3
- and so on until i = target
# Abstraction
- only show what's needed dont clutter so the following
- The list
- current index
- target
- values
- code in the momment
# Algorithmic Design
- generate random list 
- from list pick target value or random select target value
- once search is innitiated visually see how Linear search works
- once index is found show
- code won't run if not in list

## Steps to Run 
- open hugging face link
- create new list
- pick random or choose valid target
- increase or decrease size to your pleasure 
- when you're ready press start search
